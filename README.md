# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose
We want to see what factors contribute to successful start-ups

## Analysis and Challenges

I started this way too late and didn't have enough time to finish the second part, so that would be my difficulties.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  For the most successful outcome, it is best to start around the second quarter, specifically May.
  It is also best to not start near the end of the year as businesses slow down according to the data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
No result
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Time management will be considered for the next one.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
You should never have a launch date around the end of the year and the months of February through May are the best to start one.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    
    The currencies are not all the same. There is not many years of information, so a larger year dataset would be good.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    We could analyze how willing countries are to donating to a start up.
